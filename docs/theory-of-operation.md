# Theory of Operation: [Module Name]

## System Overview

[High-level description of how the module works. What are the major functional blocks
and how do they interact?]

## Block Descriptions

### [Block 1: e.g., Power Supply]

[How this block works, key design choices, critical components.]

### [Block 2: e.g., Exponential Converter]

[How this block works, key design choices, critical components.]

### [Block 3: e.g., Oscillator Core]

[How this block works, key design choices, critical components.]

### [Block 4: e.g., Waveshapers]

[How this block works, key design choices, critical components.]

### [Block 5: e.g., Output Buffers]

[How this block works, key design choices, critical components.]

## Critical Design Relationships

[Describe any critical interactions between blocks, e.g., how the VREF stability
affects oscillator tuning, or how ground routing affects noise performance.]
