# Design Notes: [Module Name]

This document captures analog/electrical rationale, key calculations, and design
tradeoffs that are not obvious from the schematic alone.

## Key Calculations

### [Calculation 1: e.g., Resistor Values for 1V/Oct Scaling]

```
[Show the math, e.g.:]
R_scale = ...
Tolerance requirement: 0.1% for < 5 cent error
```

### [Calculation 2: e.g., Regulator Thermal Budget]

```
[Show the math]
```

## Component Selection Rationale

### [Critical Component 1]
- **Chosen:** [Part number]
- **Why:** [Reason]
- **Alternatives:** [What else was considered]

### [Critical Component 2]
- **Chosen:** [Part number]
- **Why:** [Reason]
- **Alternatives:** [What else was considered]

## Layout Considerations

- [Thermal isolation requirements]
- [Decoupling placement]
- [Ground routing strategy]
- [Keep-out zones]
- [Signal routing priorities]

## Known Limitations

- [Any known tradeoffs or compromises in the current design]
